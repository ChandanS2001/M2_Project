The main objective of this project is to provide an advanced home security system
using microcontroller ATmega 328P, GSM module and chloroform gas. Home security is
very important nowadays as the possibilities of theft are increasing day by day. There has
been much research done on various types of Home Security systems like Sensor based
Home security System, Face recognition, Finger print, Palm print and keypad activation
for authentication and so on. Many technologies have been used to capture an
unauthorized movement using CCTV cameras and motion cameras, but they were failing
in stopping the theft from being happening. Overcoming these drawbacks, this project is
used to catch the thief from escaping away. This system consists of ATmega 328P
microcontroller, fingerprint sensor, DC gear motor, IR sensor, DC servo motor, buzzer,
chloroform sprayer and GSM module. Whenever the IR sensor senses the thief entering
into the room, the security system locks all the doors and windows. At the same time
chloroform sprayer releases its gas inside the room and makes the thief goes into
unconscious. Then the alarm present in the security system alert its surrounding peoples
and also GSM module is used to communicate with the owner of the house and police
station.
